## NYC crash data: insights into efficient public policies with spatial analyses 

<br>Overview<br>

We design a complete workflow from the ETL process, build a Data lakehouse architecture, perform data analysis with Power BI and streamlit, and machine learning forecasting with PROPHET algorithm.

We used Databricks and applied Agile methodologies, these allowed us to code, test, and release applications on a weekly basis! We worked simultaneously on development and production processes, operating more efficiently and innovating faster.
